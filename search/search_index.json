It is possible that a folder being locked is caused by a file inside the folder being opened by another program. You can find the blocking file path in \"File sync errors\" dialog. Closing the application that opening the file could solve the problem. \u201cFile is locked by another user\u201d This error indicates that the file may have been locked by another user on the server or by another user via the client. \u201cError when indexing\u201d This error indicates that the client cannot index the file properly, the file may be opened by other applications or by antivirus software. You can find the file path in \"File sync errors\" dialog. Closing the application that opening the file could solve the problem. You can also add exemption for Seafile client in antivirus software. To trigger syncing for the file again, just update the file. \u201dPath ends with space or period characte\u201c This error indicates that a file name or directory name ending with a space or dot cannot be synchronized to Windows. \u201cPath contains invalid characters like \u2018|\u2018 or \u2018:\u2019\u201d This error indicates that the file or directory name contains illegal characters like '|' and ':' and cannot be synchronized to Windows. \u201cUpdate to file denied by folder permission setting\u201d This error indicates that the folder has been set with unwritable folder permissions on the server, making it impossible to upload or update files. \u201cSyncing is denied by cloud-only permission settings\u201d This error indicates that the library or subfolder has non-synchronizable sharing permissions set on the server (e.g. cloud preview), which makes it impossible to synchronize the library to the computer. \u201dCreated or updated a file in a non-writable library or folder\u201c This error indicates that the library or subfolder permissions are not read-write, so the client ignores changes under that folder. \u201cPermission denied on server\u201d This error indicates that the library has been unshared. \u201cDo not have write permission to the library\u201d This error indicates that the shared permissions of the library are not read-write. \u201dinternal Server Error\u201c This error indicates that synchronization was not possible due to a server error, usually caused by a library or file on the server that has become corrupted. \u201cInternal data corrupt on the client. Please try to resync the library\u201d This error indicates that the client's metadata has been corrupted, usually due to antivirus software mistakenly deleting the client's metadata. On Windows you need to configure your antivirus software to skip the folder C:\\users\\username\\Seafile\\seafile-data, on macOS you need to skip the folder /Users/username/Seafile/.seafile-data. \u201cFailed to write data on the client. Please check disk space or folder permissions\u201d This error indicates that the file could not be checked out properly due to incorrect permissions on the local directory or insufficient disk space when the file was downloaded. Both metadata directories and synchronization directories can cause this error. \u201cNot enough memor\u201d This error indicates that the computer does not have enough memory, causing the client to fail to allocate memory. Memory allocation may also fail due to other reasons. \u201cConcurrent updates to file. File is saved as conflict file\u201d This error indicates that the same file happened to be updated locally when the file was downloaded, and will save the local file as a conflict file. \u201cA folder that may contain not-yet-uploaded files is moved to seafile-recycle-bin folder.\u201d This error means that when a folder is deleted on the server, there are changes in the folder locally that have not been uploaded, and the folder is moved to the C:\\users\\username\\Seafile\\recycle-bin directory on Windows, or to the /Users/username/Seafile/recycle-bin directory on macOS. \u201cThe file path contains symbols that are not supported by the Windows system\u201d This error indicates that the macOS or Linux client is uploading files or directory names that contain symbols that are not supported by Windows. This is just a warning that these files will not be synchronized to Windows and will not affect the upload. You can disable this popup in the client configuration. \u201cLibrary cannot be synced since it has too many files.\u201d This error indicates that the number of files in the library exceeds the maximum number of files that can be synchronized, and the client cannot synchronize such a library. \u201cWaiting for confirmation to delete files\u201d This error indicates that the number of files deleted locally at one time has exceeded the threshold that requires deletion confirmation, and a deletion confirmation operation is required.By default, more than 500 files need to be deleted at one time. Users can modify this threshold in the client configuration. \u201cFiles cannot be uploaded to this library due to file number limit settings.\u201d This error indicates that the number of files in the library is about to exceed the library's file count limit, and the server is refusing to upload more files. \u201cFailed to upload file blocks. Please check network or firewall\u201d Since the client uploads files in batches, some blocks of files can cause this error when they are not uploaded to the server properly due to network or firewall settings. \u201cPath has character case conflict with existing file or folder. Will not be downloaded\u201d This error indicates that a file with the same name but a different case has been included locally when the file was downloaded, which is caused by the fact that macOS and Windows are not case-sensitive. <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"drive_client/drive_client_for_linux/","title":"Using Seafile Drive Client on Linux","text":""},{"location":"drive_client/drive_client_for_linux/#use-appimage","title":"Use AppImage","text":"<p>Since 3.0.12 version, we only provide official packages in AppImage format.
