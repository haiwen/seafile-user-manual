# Kanban View

The Kanban view in Seafile utilizes a card-based layout, ideal for task management and categorization.

Each file or project can be treated as a card, which can be organized into different columns based on various properties, such as file type.  

This layout provides a more intuitive experience compared to the table view.

It is extremely useful for visualizing workflows, tracking progress, and managing tasks related to files.
