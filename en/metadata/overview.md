# Metadata Overview

Metadata refers to the supplementary information about files.  It serves as a powerful tool, enabling users to manage, search, and categorize files more efficiently.

For image files, metadata may include details such as the capture time, shooting device, geographical location.

In the case of document files, metadata typically contains information like the creator, modification time, and file type.

The metadata function empowers users to attach a wide range of properties to files.

Based on this, users can create different views tailored to their needs, enabling them to view, organize, and manipulate data in the most suitable way.

Seafile currently supports four views: table view, kanban view, map view, and gallery view.  

Each view has its unique characteristics and application scenarios to meet the requirements for presenting different types of data.
