# Table View

The Table View displays all files in the library in a structured format, similar to a traditional spreadsheet.  

It displays key metadata for each file, such as file name, creator, created time, Last modifier, file type (e.g., image, document), and file size.

The Table View is highly suitable for scenarios where you need in - depth information about files.  It is especially beneficial when you plan to carry out filtering, sorting, and bulk management operations.
